# HybridAngleControl-HAC
Dynamical Model of a Grid-Forming Converter Connected to an Infinite Bus via Transmission Line

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts correponding to the closed-loop dynamical model of a single converter connected to an infinite bus (SCIB) via a dynamic line model. The implemented grid-forming frequency control is the hybrid angle control (HAC). The paper that introduces the HAC technique has been submitted to IEEE CDC2020 conference and its preprint will be soon avialble on arxiv. Moreoever, this repository will be updated with various SIMULINK implementations.
