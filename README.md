# HybridAngleControl-HAC
Implementation of Grid-Forming HAC for Converter Connected to an Infinite Bus

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts correponding to the closed-loop dynamical model of a single converter connected to an infinite bus (SCIB) via a dynamic line. The implemented grid-forming frequency control strategy is termed hybrid angle control (HAC). A paper presenting the HAC technique has been submitted to IEEE CDC 2020 conference and its preprint will be avialble on arxiv. Moreoever, this repository will be updated with various SIMULINK implementations.
